# Puzzle Jigsaw with Hint

This project creates a jigsaw puzzle game where users are provided with hints to help them solve the puzzle. The goal is to assemble pieces of the puzzle into their correct positions to form a complete image.

## Project Structure

- **Puzzle Generation:** Breaks down an image into jigsaw puzzle pieces.
- **User Interaction:** Provides a user interface for dragging and dropping puzzle pieces into the correct location.
- **Hint System:** Includes a hint feature that assists the user in placing puzzle pieces correctly.
- **Evaluation:** Checks when the puzzle has been completed successfully.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need the following Python packages:

- `pygame` (for handling the game interface)
- `numpy` (for image manipulation)
- `opencv-python` (to handle image reading and processing)
- `matplotlib` (optional for plotting or image visualization)
  
You can install these dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pygame numpy opencv-python matplotlib
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required dependencies using the command above.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook `Puzzle jigsaw with hint.ipynb`.
4. Run the notebook to initialize the game.

## How to Play

1. **Loading the Puzzle:** Load the image that will be broken into puzzle pieces.
2. **Assembling the Puzzle:** Use drag-and-drop actions to place each puzzle piece in its correct location.
3. **Using Hints:** Click the "Hint" button for assistance. The hint may highlight the correct region for a selected piece.
4. **Completion:** Once all pieces are correctly placed, the puzzle is considered solved, and the user is congratulated.

## Methodology

- **Image Segmentation:** The input image is divided into multiple puzzle pieces, which are shuffled randomly.
- **Hint Mechanism:** The hint system provides visual cues or suggestions based on the puzzle's current state, helping users to solve the puzzle faster.
- **Puzzle Validation:** Checks whether all pieces are correctly placed and notifies the player upon completion.

## Usage

To run the puzzle game:

1. Load the desired image in the Jupyter notebook.
2. The game window will display shuffled puzzle pieces.
3. Drag the pieces to assemble the image.
4. Use the hint option for guidance if needed.
